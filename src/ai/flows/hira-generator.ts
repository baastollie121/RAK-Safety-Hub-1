  prompt: `You are an expert safety officer specializing in creating South African OHS Act-compliant Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) documents. Your task is to generate a professional HIRA document in Markdown format based on the provided data.

The document must follow this exact structure:
1.  **Header Section**: Include the company name and task title.
2.  **Contents/Hazards List**: Create a numbered list of all identified hazard descriptions.
3.  **Generic Control Measures Section**: Include the standard safety measures provided below.
4.  **Risk Assessment Matrix Explanation**: Include the provided explanation of the risk matrix.
5.  **Detailed Hazard Analysis Table**: Create a Markdown table with the specified columns, populating it with the hazard data provided. You have been provided with the pre-calculated risk ratings.
6.  **Approval Section**: Include the review date and signature blocks.

### Task HIRA

**Contents/Hazards:**
{{#each hazards}}
{{add @index 1}}. {{{this.hazard}}}
{{/each}}

---

### Generic Control Measures

- **Competency and Training**: All personnel must be competent and trained for their assigned tasks.
- **Equipment Inspections**: Daily pre-use inspections of all tools and equipment are mandatory.
- **System Compliance**: Adherence to all established safety systems, including RAMS (Risk Assessment Method Statements), permits, and traffic management plans.
- **Equipment Maintenance**: All equipment must be maintained in accordance with manufacturer instructions.
- **Information and Communication**: Regular toolbox talks and safety briefings will be conducted.
- **Signage**: Adequate safety signage must be in place and visible.
- **Disciplinary Action**: Non-compliance with safety procedures will result in disciplinary action.
- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Mandatory use of required PPE at all times.
- **Defective Equipment**: Any defective equipment must be immediately removed from service, tagged, and reported.

---

### Risk Assessment Matrix

The risk assessment is conducted using the following matrix:

**Step 1: Likelihood Rating (L)**
- 0: Impossible
- 1: Almost impossible
- 2: Highly unlikely
- 3: Unlikely
- 4: Possible
- 5: Even chance

**Step 2: Consequence/Severity Rating (S)**
- 0: No injury
- 1: Minor first aid injury
- 2: Break bone/minor illness/1st-2nd degree burns
- 3: Break bone/minor illness/3rd-4th degree burns over 50% body
- 4: Loss of limb/eye/serious illness/50%+ burns
- 5: Fatality

**Step 3: Risk Rating (R) = Likelihood Ã— Consequence**

**Action Requirements:**
- **16-25 (High Risk)**: Stop work immediately. The risk must be reduced before work can proceed.
- **6-15 (Medium Risk)**: Introduce and implement control measures to reduce the risk to a lower level.
- **0-5 (Low Risk)**: No immediate action required, but monitoring is recommended.
